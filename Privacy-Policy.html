            <p class="para">Specific uses of personal information that vary from this Privacy Statement (if any) may be found throughout the site. To the extent that, during your submission of information on the site, you are notified of privacy practices that are different from those described in this Privacy Statement, those alternative disclosures will govern that submission.</p>
            
            <p class="para">There may be situations where AtithiAdvisor.com collects data through a survey or similar process when the page does not link to this Statement. In those cases, unless you are informed otherwise, you should assume that AtithiAdvisor.com treats all information from such pages as it treats its other valuable business records.
            </p>    

            <p class="para">Of course, there are many other ways in which AtithiAdvisor.com could get information from or about you that are not described elsewhere in this Statement. For example, you might send email through a customer service email address, or AtithiAdvisor.com may get a complaint about you from a third party. AtithiAdvisor.com's practices with respect to such information are pretty much as you'd expect-AtithiAdvisor.com uses and discloses this information in a commercially reasonable business manner.</p>

            <p class="para">AtithiAdvisor.com uses contractors to help with its operations. Some or all of these contractors may access the databases of user information.

            <p class="para">AtithiAdvisor.com may also use third party service providers to help with certain aspects of its operations that may require disclosure of your personal information to them. For example, AtithiAdvisor.com may use a third party service provider to mail MS-Points redemption rewards, serve ads, or deliver some or all of the emails sent as part of the site's normal operation. Again, usually AtithiAdvisor.com will place extensive restrictions on the ability of these third parties to use and disclose your personal information except as necessary to perform the services they are asked to perform.
