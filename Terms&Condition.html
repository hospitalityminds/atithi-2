            <p class="para">At Atithiadvisor.com (2M Softwares), we've created a community where “hosts” members can submit and read one another's “guests” (Atithi) reviews and plan their service, marketing and approach to the “guests”. Once in a while, someone will try to game our system by attempting to post a fake review, so we thought it would be helpful to share our approach, our policies, and the actions we take to identify, block, and remove fraudulent reviews. Here's what we believe.</p>

        </div>



        <div class="para-container">
            <h2 class="para-header">We believe that reliable feedback comes from fellow host.</h2>

            <h2 class="para-header">We believe in "the right to write."</h2>

            <p class="para">The Atithiadvisor.com (2M Softwares) community has a wealth of valuable experience, and every one of our user should feel confident sharing their opinions. We are attempting to create a platform where “Host” can share and read reviews / ratings of their “guests” and hence “know your guest” before they check in and enhance their experience. Alternatively “guests” can get rewarded for maximum good ratings and avail benefits given by hosts. With one of its kind of unique platform for hosts, you have a fundamental right to talk about that experience with others. We are immensely proud of the community are building built which helps both hospitality fraternity, even guests and travel community . </p>

            <p class="para">We believe every experience counts and every small effort builds a strong community. Not just the ones who have made reservation but all who have checked in along, all of them should be reviewed / rated. That's what Atithiadvisor.com (2M Softwares) stands for.</p>

            <p class="para">“Guests” (Atithi) are the main pillars of the industry and we at Atithiadvisor.com (2M Softwares) believe to enhance their stay and travel experience by providing various customisations,focussed services , and many benefits like discounts, upgrades etc to them.</p>
            
             <p class="para">Because we believe in promoting personal experiences, we do not take lightly the decision to remove a review from our site. It might be easier to give in to censorship and remove reviews that a guest / business owner disagrees with. But it goes against what we stand for, which is the right for genuine hosts to share their experiences.</p>   

             <p class="para"> In keeping with this philosophy, while we do require reviewers to certify that they are reviewing their own experiences before they can submit their review to Atithiadvisor.com (2M Softwares), we don’t seek third-party verification.</p>

Wehave proprietary algorithms that calculate a hosts'  and Guests’ (Atithis’) rank, to ascertain “Host of the Month” and “Guest (Atithi) of the Month”. Those processes and algorithms are applied in the same way to all content, complaints and properties. We never have and never will give our advertisers or anyone else preferential treatment.</p>

        <div class="para-container">
            <h2 class="para-header">We believe that those who don't play by the rules should be penalised.</h2>

            <p class="para">Hosts rely heavily on reviews when making business decisions. Unfortunately some unscrupulous entities will try to cheat in order to get higher reviews / ratings. We define “cheating” as hosts positively reviewing guests (or finding others to do so on their behalf) in lieu of some benefits.</p>

            <p class="para">These activities constitute fraud. Posting fake reviews violates the Atithiadvisor.com (2M Softwares) Terms of Use, as well as unfair to the audience, also violates consumer protection laws in many countries.
